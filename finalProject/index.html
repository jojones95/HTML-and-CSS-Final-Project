    <h2 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Biography:</h2>
    <div>I was born in Orlando, Florida, and my family lived in the south for many years. We moved to Michigan in 1992 and settled in Lake City.
      After my time in active duty I returned to Traverse City where I eventually started attending NMC. I plan to finish my degree there and
      transfer to the University of Michigan where I will finish a bachelors degree in aerospace engineering.

    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">From the Army to NASA</h2>
    <p>After highschool I spent several years in the Army, including service in the US, Germany, and one combat deployment to Iraq.
      When I left the Army I entered the culinary profession and quickly moved from "dish dog" to Executive Chef. 
      After several years in the culinary field, and becoming a father, I decided to leave the culinary industry and get into CNC machining. I eagerly learned the craft and began
      to hone my skills as a machinist.

    <p style="padding-top; 25px;">I worked in aerospace manufacturing as a CNC machinist for three years. During this time I quickly learned the intricacies of programming, 
      workholding, tooling, metallurgy, and other skills associated with CNC machining.  I then decided to take my career to the next level by persuing an engineering degree.

    <p>Since I started my engineering degree at Northwestern Michigan College I have excelled academically. I have since been selected for and completed several 
      competetive undergraduate research and design programs with NASA, and was awarded a highly coveted internship with NASA in the summer of 2019. I am currently an engineering
      student at NMC and continue to work with NASA in a variety of functions, while preparing for a professional career with them. See the "NASA Projects" tab for more information about the work I've done with NASA.
